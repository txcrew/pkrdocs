Location refers to the specific coordinates that define a propertyâ€™s position on a map, as well as its relationship to any encompassing parent property. 

## Coordinates

Numerical values that specify a precise location on a map, visualized with a pin to indicate the property's position.

* `California Adventure` is at coordinates `33.8062,-117.9199`
