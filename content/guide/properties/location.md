Location refers to the specific coordinates that define a propertyâ€™s position on a map, as well as its relationship to any encompassing parent property. 

Most all properties have a physical location, save for property types that travel (ex: Cruise ships).

## Coordinates

Numerical values that specify a precise location on a map, visualized with a pin to indicate the property's position.

## Located within

Properties that are located within another property are displayed together in a hierarchical in a location tree.

Example
* `Tomorrowland` is in located within `Magic Kingdom`
* `California Adventure` is located within `Disneyland Resort`
* `Brooklyn` is located within `New York City`
