The date [operation status]({{< ref "status" >}}) became `defunct`.


## Fields

| Field         | Summary                     		    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `date`   | As `Year`, `Year + Month` or `Year + Month + day`     |
| `note`  	| Any relevant information to give context    |

## Usage

Start dates are used to communicate when a property `operational status` is changed to `defunct`.

A timeline can have multiple `End dates` if a property is [replaced]({{< ref "replaced" >}}) by a new one, then the original property is brought back and later it gets replaced again by something completely different.


## Example

### Single end date

The `end date` for `The Living Seas` at `EPCOT` is `2005 Aug 21`


### Multiple end dates

The `end date` for `Captain EO` at `EPCOT` is:
* `1996`
* `2015`

Each start date is a unique point on the timeline.
