The date [operation status]({{< ref "status" >}}) became `active`.


## Fields

| Field         | Summary                     		    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `date`   | As `Year`, `Year + Month` or `Year + Month + day`     |
| `note`  	| Any relevant information to give context    |

## Usage

Start dates are used to communicate when a property `operational status` is changed to `active`.

A timeline can have multiple `Start dates` if a property is [replaced]({{< ref "replaced" >}}), and later the original property is brought back to replace the new one.

## Example

### Single start date

The `start date` for `Spaceship Earth` at `EPCOT` is `1982 Oct 1`

### Multiple start dates

The `start date` for `Happily Ever After` at `Magic Kingdom` is:
* `2017 May 12`
* `2023 Apr 3`

Each start date is a unique point on the timeline.
