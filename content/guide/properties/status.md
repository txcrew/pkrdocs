The operational status reflects the physical state of a property. An operational status is required for every property.

## Types

| Status        | Summary                                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `active`      | Physically exists; daily operation not withstanding                                      |
| `defunct`     | The property in the documented state no longer exists  |
| `development` | Doesnâ€™t exist just yet, but it's planned!     |
| `seasonal`    | Operates a few months out of the year            |
| `unknown`     | Not sure about the status                |

## Example

`Horizons` loacted within `Future World` in `EPCOT` at `Walt Disney World Resort` is `Defunct`


1. `Horizons` is the `Attraction`
2. `Future world` is the `Area`
3. `EPCOT` is the `Park`
4. `Walt Disney World Resort` is the resort
5. `Defunct` is the Operational status

## Usage

The operational status should be updated when a property is:
* Announced - typically as `development` unless it's announced on the `start date`
* Opens - as `active` usually coincides with `start date`
* Closes - `defunct` usually coincides with `end date` but it can differ as properties can experience extended, or indefinite closures
* Indefinite closure - `unknown`
