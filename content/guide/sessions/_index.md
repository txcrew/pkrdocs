Sessions are cumulative records of visits over a period of time. 

They're like an album; you choose what goes in. For example you can create sessions for your:

* Activity on a given day
* Activity over a series of days
* Historical activity over an unknown timeframe

## Overview

Every visit you log is stored in a session, with all visits automatically sorted into individual [trackers]({{< ref "trackers" >}}) for each property. Sessions are private by default but can be selectively [shared]({{< ref "share" >}}) publicly.


## Starting a session

Sessions are created automatically ðŸ™Œ. You may also choose to manually create a session as needed.


### Automatic
Sessions are automatically created on your first logged visit of each calendar day. 

By default, the name of each auto-generated session is today's date. This can be changed in the Edit session mode.

### Manual

For more tactical organization, a new session can be created at any point by tapping `New session`.
