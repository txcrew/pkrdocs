Sessions are only required when you log a visit.


## Create

### Automatically
Sessions are automatically created on your first logged visit of each calendar day. 

By default, the name of each auto-generated session is today's date. This can be changed in the Edit session mode.

### Manually

For more tactical organization, a new session can be created at any point by tapping `New session`.


## Organize

Your visits are automatically saved to a session. How you choose to organize sessions can change based on your needs.

For example, you create sessions for your:
* Activity on a given day
* Activity over a series of days
* Historical activity over an unknown timeframe
