Trackers record all visits to a property during a session, including property details, personal commentary and uploaded media, much like a news article.

Most tracker content is auto-populated to reduce your logging effort.

## Features

### Property details

Trackers automatically summarize and display the property's location, classifications, and specifications for clear context.

### Visits

All your visits to a unique property are consolidated into a single tracker, keeping your session clear and easy to read.

The number of visits can be easily modified using the `change visit count` action in the tracker settings menu.

### Commentary

Optionally include your own brief or detailed commentary on the property.

### Media

Optionally upload your own media to enhance your tracker details.
