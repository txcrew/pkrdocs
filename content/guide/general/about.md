Park Ranger is a tool crafted for exploring and documenting your activity at recreational destinations including theme parks, national parks, stadiums and beyond. It was designed and created by a couple of theme park enthusiasts with a natural curiosity and joy for discovering the details in an experience.

## Manifesto
